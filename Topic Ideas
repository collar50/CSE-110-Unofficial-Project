A few ideas to get our list of ideas started

1) (Auto Quiz) An application that allows users to create quiz questions and generates a new quiz application that is self-grading. 

2) (Auto Cover Letter) An application that automatically writes cover letters and lets you preview them. You would enter in certain information,
    and choose options for customization from lists.
    
3) (Budget Planner) An application that plans your monthly budget. It should allow you to enter in new items and their price and see your data bank 
    of all the items you have entered in over time. You should be able to add quantities of those items to your monthly 
    expenditures, you should be able to see the list of your total monthly expenditures, and you should be able to delete items
    at will. Ultimately, the program should calculate your total monthly expenditures. 
    
4) (Contact Book) A contact book that allows you to create new contacts and store their names, email addresses, phone numbers, and a description
    (and maybe a photo). You can also create categories (maybe color coded), and assign those contacts to those categories. You should
    then be able to filter over category.
    
5) (Day Planner) A calendar/day programmer where you can create categories (again, color coded), and assign each of your events to different 
    categories. You should be able to see your monthly calendar, weekly calendar, and day planner. You should also be able to see a list of 
    all of the events in each different category for the day, week, and month. Maybe we could also set up an alert system.
